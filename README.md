# Cat-Photo-App-Bootstrap is a modified version of the most popular Responsive Web Design project on FreeCodeCamp
Bootstrap is a front-end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, which is why it doesn't require a thorough styles.css stylesheet.
